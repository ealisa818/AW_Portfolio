            Hi, I'm Alisa.
            <br className="hidden lg:inline-block" />I love meeting new people, collaborating and, of course, building new apps.

          After teaching English to speakers of other languages for over 20 years, I decided to make a career change to Web Development. Before teaching, I earned a degree in Actuarial Science from the University of Georgia. I am looking for an opportunity where I can use both my analytical thinking and problem solving skills. In addition to teaching, I have always strived to take on leadership roles in the schools where I taught.  These roles have included acting as the liaison between the teachers and the school management, as well as being the district wide department leader. In Germany, together with a business partner, I started and ran Hamburg Language Lounge, a language school combined with a bar/caf√©. I love learning about new cultures and studying languages. I am fluent in German and speak conversational French and Thai.
